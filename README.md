# Capstone-Project

Simple console-based Python game where you find the real numbers inside a grid using the row and column sums. Built with Rich to add colour to the interface.

# How to Play:
1. An nxn grid will be generated using an input from the user, with a random amount of real numbers that the user must find amongst filler numbers.
2. The sum of all real numbers in each row and column is provided.
3. The goal is to mark all of the real numbers in the grid.
4. You can clear the filler numbers to make it easier to view.
